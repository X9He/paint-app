# paintApp

This paint application achieves painting by tracking mouse down and drag movements on the canvas. It was done in intellij.

### Key features:
	- slider has ticks to indicate the end of each line (continus mouse drag movement until mouse is released)
	- if you slide to anywhere on the slider and continue drawing, all lines after the tick you're at is destroyed and canvas will only add new lines you are drawing
	- you can save and load painting projects (no extension restriction)
	- you can play your drawing from any point on the tick
